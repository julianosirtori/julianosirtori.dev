A few days ago, I had to develop a feature that required merging two arrays. Initially, I used the [spread operator (...)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Spread_syntax), resulting in the following code:

```js
const array1 = Array.from({length: 10000}, (_, index) => index)
const array2 = Array.from({length: 10000}, (_, index) => index)

const all = [...array1, ...array2 ]
```
_Script duration in milliseconds **7.838104993104935**_

At first, this solved my problem, and I was able to merge the arrays. However, I wondered if there was a way to improve performance. Upon reviewing the documentation, I came across the [concat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/concat) method.

## Merge with Concat

The `concat` method is used specifically for merging two or more arrays without altering the existing arrays, but returning a new merged array. With `concat`, the merge would look like this:

```js
const array1 = Array.from({length: 10000}, (_, index) => index)
const array2 = Array.from({length: 10000}, (_, index) => index)

const all = [].concat(array1, array2)
```
_Script duration in milliseconds: **2.6480610072612762**_

As we can see, by using `concat`, we achieve a reduction of more than 50% in execution time, making it, in many cases, a much more efficient alternative than the spread operator.

## Bonus: removing duplicate items

In the same feature I was working on, I needed to remove duplicate items from the merged array. We can do this using the [indexOf](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf) method, as shown below:

```js
const array1 = Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, index) => index);
const array2 = Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, index) => index);

const all = [].concat(array1, array2);

const arrayWithoutDuplicates = all.filter(
    (item, index) => all.indexOf(item) === index
);
```
_Script duration in milliseconds: **36.275166511535645**_

As shown above, we filter the merged array by passing a callback that checks if the index of the first occurrence of the `item` in the `all` array is equal to the current `index` of the loop. This way, the callback returns `true` only for the first occurrence of the `item`.

However, we can remove duplicate items in a much more efficient way by using [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set). The `Set` object allows us to store unique values â€” each value can only occur once. This new approach would look like this:

```js
const array1 = Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, index) => index);
const array2 = Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, index) => index);

const all = [].concat(array1, array2);

const arrayWithoutDuplicates = new Set(all);
```
_Script duration in milliseconds: **2.5936660766601562**_

## Conclusion

As we can see from the examples above, proper use of techniques in JavaScript can significantly improve your code's performance. To merge arrays, we can use the `concat` method, and to remove duplicates, we can use the `Set` object.
