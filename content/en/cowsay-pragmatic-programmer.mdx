I am currently reading the book [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Apprentice to Master](https://www.amazon.com/Programador-Pragm%C3%A1tico-Aprendiz-Mestre/dp/8577807002/ref=sr_1_1), and to reinforce and remember the tips presented in it, I developed a small CLI that prints a tip from the book daily in the terminal.

I have set up the CLI in my terminal initialization file (.zshrc), so every time I open it, a random tip is displayed.

I also took the opportunity to use "bun." For those who don't know, bun is a competitor to Node.js.

You can download the CLI on [GitHub](https://github.com/julianosirtori/cowsay-pragmatic-programmer).
