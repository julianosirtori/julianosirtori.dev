To create a monorepo with pnpm, we will need to create a file named `pnpm-workspace.yaml` inside our repository.

```shell
touch pnpm-workspace.yaml
```

Inside the `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, we will define our packages. It will have a structure similar to this:

```yml
packages:
  - 'app'
  - 'api'
  - 'utils'
  - 'services'
```

Now we can reference our workspace packages as follows:

```json
{  
	"dependencies": {  
		"@repo/utils": "workspace:*",
		"@repo/services": "workspace:*"  
	}  
}
```

You can find more details in the [pnpm documentation](https://pnpm.io/workspaces). As we can see, many of the largest frameworks in the market use this approach.

### Bonus

To optimize our development workflow, we can integrate [Turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/getting-started/add-to-project), a tool that simplifies running scripts across multiple `packages.json` simultaneously.
