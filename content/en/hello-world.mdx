One of my goals for the year 2023 was to finally implement my blog. I had been wanting to create one for a while to improve and expand my online presence. Fortunately, I managed to overcome procrastination and finally completed it.

In this article, I will detail the development and design process, the libraries I used for implementation, and the next steps. If you wish to examine the code, you can access it on my GitHub: [https://github.com/julianosirtori/julianosirtori.dev](https://github.com/julianosirtori/julianosirtori.dev)

## Design

I believe the most challenging part of this project was defining the design. Initially, I had in mind a concept with many animations and impressive visual effects. However, after analyzing some references in the field, such as the website [https://kentcdodds.com](https://kentcdodds.com/) and [https://leerob.io](https://leerob.io/), I opted for a simpler approach.

### First Version

I managed to implement a first version of the design, which is presented below:

I wasn't very satisfied with the result; I thought the screen looked somewhat cluttered. I was looking for something simpler and more minimalist.

### Second Version

I came across the website of [Zeno Rocha](https://zenorocha.com/), liked his design a lot, and ended up replicating both the layout and the structure of his blog, making only a few minor adjustments.

In the future, I plan to make some changes to customize the blog according to my style, but at this early stage, I am quite satisfied with the result.

## Technology Stack Used

As for the technology used, I opted for a stack composed of the following options:

* **Next.js 13:** I chose Next.js due to my familiarity with it and took the opportunity to test the new features of version 13.

* **Tailwind CSS:** This is my first project using Tailwind CSS. The learning curve is a bit steep, but the use of extensions for VSCode has been very helpful. I am pleased with the results and plan to use Tailwind CSS in future projects.

* **Contentlayer:** To transform my files, which are in Markdown format, into data, similar to a CMS, I chose to use Contentlayer. The integration was quite easy, and it wasn't necessary to set up any additional CMS services. Additionally, it provides type safety for my articles.

* **Next-intl:** As you can see, my blog offers the option to choose between English and Portuguese. To implement this internationalization, I used Next-intl, opting for a beta version due to the use of server components and the app router.

* **Resend:** I also chose Resend as my email service. I had never used it before, but I found the integration quite easy to perform.

* **Vercel:** As for the infrastructure, I chose to use Vercel.

## Future Improvements

On GitHub, I have mapped out some improvements that I plan to implement, such as the integration of end-to-end tests, the creation of pipelines for CI/CD, and the replacement of kbar with cmdk.

In addition to the topics mentioned above, I plan to make some changes to the layout by adding transition animations and exploring the inclusion of more images to enrich articles and projects.

## Writing Habit

I intend to cultivate the habit of writing, which will help me better solidify the content I learn and strengthen my online presence. I'm documenting this here so that you can hold me accountable later. My intention is to publish one article per week.

## Conclusion

The project is open-source under the MIT license, so feel free to clone it, open issues, or submit pull requests.

THAT'S ALL FOLKS
